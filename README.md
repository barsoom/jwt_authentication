# JwtAuthentication

WIP!

A rack middleware to provide simple JWT token based authentication (for Single Sign On).

In the first version this is simply a way to give access, not identify the user.

NOTE: Not suitable for apps with advanced forms since it will redirect after the session timeout loosing the data.
